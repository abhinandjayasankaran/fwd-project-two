+ ## Revision-2 Changes
+ # --------------------

+ In my second revision I have made changes to the overall organization of my css following
+ the smacss structure. I have also fixed some minor link errors and performed an overall
+ survey using google lighthouse in firefox to get an understanding of how my accessibility
+ and performance is. My end goal is to be able to convert the site into a PWA by making
+ some more minor fixes.

+ ## Revision-3 changes
+ # --------------------

+ Media Queries are adjusted to be better at wrapping text for certain screen sizes.
+ A new feature using js is added to display live date on the navbar.
