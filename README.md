This repo contains my project work (two) for fundamentals of web development. The code consists mainly of CSS assets along with the structural HTML5 which is used to construct my initial webpage templates.

+ ## Revision-2 Changes
+ # --------------------

+ In my second revision I have made changes to the overall organization of my css following
+ the smacss structure. I have also fixed some minor link errors and performed an overall
+ survey using google lighthouse in firefox to get an understanding of how my accessibility
+ and performance is. My end goal is to be able to convert the site into a PWA by making
+ some more minor fixes.
