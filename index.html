        <h2 id="about-heading">About Me</h2>
        <p id="about-paragraph">I am a computer science undergrad at IIT minoring in Entrepreneurship.
            I am currently focused on developing solutions for computer vision problems using OpenCV and
            Python, however, I love developing web applications (Full-Stack) and integrating
            my back-end programs to enable cloud computing capabilities using AWS or Heroku.
            I have been working on developing my technical skills to help me solve computer vision problems for the past 2 years
            and has been a very interesting journey. During my extensive study into the field I have been able to identify a problem area
            which I hope to solve. Computer Vision, even though highly advanced and promising, still is in its infantry I believe and has
            a long way to go in terms of its true potential and for that I believe accesibility to the technology should be improved upon.
            The path to finding a solution for the issue has led me to embark on setting up my entrepreneural venture by establishing a startup.
            Currently I am focused on interviewing potential customer groups in order to approach the product design from a human-centered
            design perspective.</p>
